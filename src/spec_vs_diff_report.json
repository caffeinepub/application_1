  "summary": "Diff adds a new CakeSection, wires it into App rendering behind a siteConfig visibility toggle, updates Header navigation to be config-driven (including a Cake icon/item), and adds new global CSS animations for flame/smoke. However, the diff summary does not show the required generated image assets being added, and the exact required popup text/accessible dismissal behavior cannot be fully verified from the truncated CakeSection content.",

      "requirement": "Clicking/tapping the cake/candle opens a popup with the exact text “Happy B’day!” (English).",
      "reason": "The provided evidence only indicates a popup with \"Happy B'day!\" (straight apostrophe) and the CakeSection file is truncated before showing the exact rendered dialog text, so the exact required string with the curly apostrophe (B’day) cannot be confirmed.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "The popup is accessible: it can be dismissed via click/tap and via keyboard (Escape) if implemented as a dialog.",
      "reason": "CakeSection imports Dialog components, but the truncated snippet does not show how the dialog open/close is wired (e.g., onOpenChange, close button/overlay click behavior). Therefore dismissal via click/tap and Escape cannot be verified from the diff summary alone.",

      "reason": "CakeSection references the required filenames via /assets/generated/... paths, but the diff summary does not show any new files added under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the existence of the required image assets cannot be confirmed.",
